# Personal site

This is my markdown based static personal portfolio site.

It has custom static site generator (build.js) that supports
latex based math formulas and syntax highlighting.

It's based on [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) markdown parser.

Here some math formulas:

$(a+b)^2= a^2 + 2ab + b^2$

$ E = mc^2$

Here some code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
