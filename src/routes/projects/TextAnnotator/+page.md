## Description

This tool allows you to add notes to text in a monospace (fixed-width) font.
You can use this to add notes to a line of code, help explain terminal output,
annotate ASCII math expressions, etc.

Then result can be rendered as HTML, SVG, or ASCII escape sequences or image.

The SVG, HTML or image can be pasted into a note taking app (like Obsidian)
or a website.
